## My process

### Built with

- **Version 2 (Latest)** (Upgraded from basic HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to a modern tech stack)

  - React + TypeScript
  - Vite for faster development
  - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
  - Improved and more accurate UI/UX design

- **Version 1 (Old)** (Originally built two years ago)
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Mobile-first workflow
  - [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

- Significant improvement in UI/UX accuracy based on project requirements.
- Transitioning from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS for better flexibility.
- Leveraging TypeScript for type safety and scalability.
- Optimized component-based structure using React.
- Documentation writing (this project introduced me to structured `README.md` creation).

### Continued development

- Enhancing React component reusability and optimization.
- Exploring advanced Tailwind CSS configurations.
- Improving accessibility and performance best practices.
- More refined state management solutions.
- Integrating backend logic for future scalability.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank first in myself to do these things instead of just sleeping. Also to the internet and the websites I specified in the "Useful resources" section, or some that isn't, which is probably I forgot. Also to the FrontEndMentor for providing these resources for everyone to learn much easier, and not just get stuck in tutorial hell watching random videos.
