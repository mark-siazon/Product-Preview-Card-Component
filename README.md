# FM-Product-Preview-Card-Component - GitHub Pages Deployment

This branch contains the production-ready files for the **FM-Product-Preview-Card-Component** project, which are generated by running the `npm run build` command and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Purpose of This Branch

This branch is used to host the built version of the project on GitHub Pages. It contains only the `dist/` folder generated by the Vite build process. Any changes made to this branch will be overwritten by the deployment process, so **do not make direct changes here**.

### How to Update This Branch

1. **Make Changes in Main Branch**: All code changes should be made in the `main` branch (or your default branch).
2. **Build the Project**: After making changes, run the following command in the main branch to generate the production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Test the Build**: Use the `preview` script to deploy the new build to the `gh-pages` branch:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

   This will test the content of the `dist/` folder before deployment to `gh-pages` branch.

4. **Deploy the Build**: Use the `deploy` script to deploy the new build to the `gh-pages` branch:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This will automatically push the content of the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

### GitHub Pages URL

Once deployed, the site will be available at:

```
https://mark-siazon.github.io/FM-Product-Preview-Card-Component/
```

This URL is automatically updated every time a new deployment occurs.

### Notes

- The `gh-pages` branch is **not meant for development**. Any modifications to the source code should be done in the main branch.
- The `dist/` folder is the production build, and the deployment process will automatically push these files to GitHub Pages.

For more information on how to deploy using `gh-pages`, please refer to the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/).
